# ASSESSMENT 5: Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is a hash in Ruby?

  Your answer:
  In Ruby a hash is a collection of key:value pairs. We worked with hashes during our hashes coding challenges.

  Researched answer:
  In Ruby a hash is a container of key: value pairs. To access the values in a hash we use CRUD (create, read, update, delete) actions that can manipulate the data in different ways by referencing the keys in a hash. Hashes are similar to arrays and ranges in that they are enumerable, which means methods such as .each and .map can be used to iterate over a hash.

2. What is a gem?

  Your answer:
  In Ruby a gem is a package manager. We used the Active Record gem when doing our coding challenges in that section.

  Researched answer:
  A gem is a open source library in Ruby that adds functionality to a program. A gem allows programmers to use the Ruby code that is in the library rather than having to insert the code into their program. 


3. What is Ruby on Rails?

  Your answer:
  Ruby on Rails is a collection of gems built in the Ruby language and it is a fullstack web application framework.  

  Researched answer:
  Ruby on Rails is a open-sourced web application framework that is written in the Ruby language. Ruby on Rails is a fullstack framework that uses MVC architecture (model, view, controller), which helps build applications by providing structure for databases, web services, and web pages. 



4. What is a relational database? Are there other kinds of databases?

  Your answer:
  A relational database is a database that represents related data in tables that can be accessed through primary keys (rows) and the values (columns). We used a relational database when working on PostgresSQL challenges.

  Researched answer:
  A relational database is a database that displays information in tables with rows and columns. The rows in the table have a unique ID called a key, each column contains attributes of the information, and a value for each attribute. This helps organize the data making it easier to access. There are many types of databases that are non-relational databases that store data. The main difference between relational and non-relational databases is that there are no tables, rows, or primary keys in non-relational databases.


5. What are primary keys? Why are they important?

  Your answer:
  Primary keys are unique indentifiers in databases that are created when a new instance of a class (object) is created. Each primary key is given a unique ID. Primary keys are important because databases use them to compare relationships between data.

  Researched answer:
  Primary keys are unique identifers in relational databases. Primary keys are assigned when new objects are created. When a primary key is assigned, the object's information cannot be duplicated because primary keys cannot be reassigned. Primary keys help keep data distinct from each other if they have similarities. Primary keys are also important because they keep data organized allowing users to identify data and manipulate it easily.   


## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week
Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. RESTful routes:
  Representational State Transfer (REST) routes provide communication between the client and server through HTML verbs and CRUD actions.

2. JSON:
  Javascript Object Notation (JSON) is a data interchange format that uses text to store and transmit Javascript object data.

3. ERB:
  Embedded Ruby (ERB) is a template that combines Ruby code and plain text. It allows you to work with both HTML and Ruby to create web apps from a database making it easier for users to maintain the code. 

4. Params:
  Params are hashes and they are the parameters passed to a controller by a GET or POST request. Params are passed in the URL through the browser in a GET request. Params get passed to the controller from a database in a POST request. 

5. API:
  Application programming interface (API) is a software interface between computers and computer programs. It allows for applications to communicate using the internet to send data requests to the server. The server then responds and presents the data.
